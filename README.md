Description of what we implemented: We basically implmented everything we descriped in our original proposal. We showed the buildings basic attributes in the index page, and detailed information including apartments, surroundings, prospect managers and tweet comments in hyperlinks to other routes.

Page description:
1. index page: we showed the building basic attributes in this page and built hyperlinks to the detailed information of each building. Besides, we implemented a search function so that the user can search a certain building.
2. /name/address/zipcode page: we showed the detailed information for each building. The route is defined by the name of the building and its primary key (address,zipcode). We wrote several SQL queries inside this detailed information page trying to show and summarize every important aspect of each building.
